this is  a demo  contain some of  my test like redis  solr ehcache smartAddress  mvc mycat and  something else

at first time  i'm not so good  at  maven module

so i don't let all of this in the module  it should  be

at last ,as you it was so ugly now

even if  it can run ,but i don't remember some of  it   even for me

so today i move  it to the  demo1

it can start up  by maven plugin  or start by  tomcat

when it  start it can  saw  at  http://localhost:8099

and  all of  other thing i will make it  at the  module   for  it



command:
    cd  demo1
    mvn tomcat7:run-war
